# Deck of Cards
This little project is a set of classes that represent a deck of poker-style playing cards. (Fifty-two playing cards in four suits: hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds, with face values of Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, and King.)

## Classes
This project is built around two main methods/operations; shuffle and dealOneCard.

### shuffle() 
Shuffle returns no value, but results in the cards in the deck being randomly permuted.

### dealOneCard() 
This function returns one card from the deck to the caller. If the caller makes a call dealOneCard() to an empty deck, then no card is dealt.
